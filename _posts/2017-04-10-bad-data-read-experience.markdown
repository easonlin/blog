# Bad Data Handbook 

### How do we measure the quality of data?
1. Do we have all data we need to answer the question?
1. Are those data related to each other?
1. Are values in data correct?
1. Can we trace it? Can we know the source and destination of personal information for each one?

### How do we trace our data
1. Snapshotting/Imutable data
1. Adding source column on data at every transition steps
1. Scoring data source if there are multiple source for same data
1. Programable data source
1. Separating each transition steps

### How to create conpaign on Kaggle
1. Defining a specific question that fit to your problem.
1. Prototyping and verifying if we can solve our problem by answering the question.
1. Preparing training data, and separating data to training, testing and answer.
1. (Optional) Extracting features.
1. Defining input/output and encoding data.
1. Describing qestion on Kaggle and answering questions from user.
1. Chosing best solution and integrating to our product.

### Data Science Trap
1. Assuming data is correct and complete.
  * We may find data lose by some simple sum or count.
  * We shouldn't assume the time range information on folder or file name is exactly match the data.
1. Limiting tools for data analysis.
